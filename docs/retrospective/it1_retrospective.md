## Iteration 1 Features
* Users can create a survey with a collection of different types of questions (will create unique user functionality and authentication in future iteration)
* Users can view all the surveys created
* Basic Firebase Firestore setup (works in the frontend, will be put in the backend in a future iteration.)

Overall, the team was able to finish all the tasks and issues for iteration 1. The team was able to set up the project repository, firebase firestore setup, and a user can view all the surveys created and create surveys with 3 different types of questions. Essentially, the barebones of the application was created in this iteration. There were some challenges associated with iteration 1. The biggest one in particular was the lack of communication between teams regarding what was completed and also what each member should do. There was a significant portion of the team that was a bit confused on the direction of the app and exactly what to code/implement for this iteration. In order to fix this, this iteration the team will make a greater effort to communicate between each other on what they are working on for this iteration. This was done using class meetings where everyone is attending, making it perfect to delegate tasks and responsibilities between each other. In addition, the team will make a greater effort to communicate on a more regular basis using slack on any potential blockers and tasks that they are working on at the moment.s
