## Iteration 3 Retrospective
* Tagging feature implemented. This was applied to both users and surveys. For the time being, it is a fixed set of categories that can be selected. We plan on adding more or making it dynamic.
* User onboarding page implemented. This makes use of the tagging feature and guides the user on the kinds of surveys they want to answer.
* Users can now edit their own previously created surveys, and see results of responses.
* The survey answering feature has received a lot of improvements. Fetching a survey is now randomized, but also makes use of a priority queue of surveys that gives surveys a calculated score.

We've got a lot of features started and implemented this iteration, with each teammake making meaningful contributions to the project. Up until this point, our UI is a little underhwelming so this is one thing that we want to work on for the future iterations. We have a lot planned for the upcoming iteration so planning is key and we already have an idea of what each person needs to do. This will also mean certain tasks need to be done before the actual iteration deadline so that others can work off of these changes.
