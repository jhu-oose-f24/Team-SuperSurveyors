## Iteration 2 Features
* User login and sign up functionality/pages have been created
* User survey creation and results are now based on user rather than a static single account
* User has a preliminary feed for seeing other people's surveys

Overall, the team was able to complete most of their tasks with relative smoothness. All deliverables were completed, but the deliverables still needed more time to be polished. In particular, the navbar needed to have the survey feed button, and the survey feed page can be made into a more smooth and cleaner experience with a UI redesign and error handling. There were better attempts at communication in iteration 2, but some communication issues still remained. In particular, some teammates had some confusion on the exact design of their deliverable, answering surveys, and they failed to communicate this blocker ahead of time. As such, in future iterations, the team will make a better effort to tell each other about blockers ahead of time and assist each other instead of last minute development and assistance.
