## About
Our app is a survey platform where people will be able to create their own serveys as well as do other people's surveys. We would like to foster an environment where users are incentivized to try other people's surveys so that their own surveys are advertised to other people. We'd also like to increase convenience of exposing these surveys to people around the world so that the survey creators can obtain all sorts of perspectives and audiences. This is not possible in traditional methods and mainstream survey apps.
