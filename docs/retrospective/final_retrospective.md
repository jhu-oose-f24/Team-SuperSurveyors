## Final Retrospective
Working on the SuperSurveyors website was a great experience where we were able to function as a group with a shared goal. At the very core of it, we kept true with our initial project proposal of a survey sharing website throughout the semester. It was satisfying to see all our foundational user stories come to fruition, and seeing these features improve over time. We also had a fun time trying to implement our nice-to-have features, with said features eventually being incorporated with the website. 

Some features that we did not deliver was more different types of questions, a more comprensive survey recommendor, and making more uses of our currency to promote activity. Nevertheless, we've made a lot of progress and these additions are not impossible to do with more time.

A challenge that we faced was organization of our codebase. Each person had their unique style of developing code and over time it became more complicated to add onto existing classes.

If we could go back in time, we would definitely do more planning on the database. Making changes to the format of our data is inevitable, but it became a headache as we created more features. Because we stuck with our core features, we should have created as many fields as we could initially. 

Furthermore, I think this project was a good benchmark on learning each of our strengths. For instance, Xin made great progress on the UI and Matt created the framework of our recommendation algorithm. It would be great to start a project knowing right away what each person can work on effectively.
